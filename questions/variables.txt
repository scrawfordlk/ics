What do variables work internally in C*?

Variables are implemented as symbolic references to values. This is done using symbol tables
which are tables where for a variable's identifier, the corresponding value can be retrieved.

Variables can be classified into two variants depending on the location of their declaration:
- Global variables that are declared in the global scope (outside of any procedure)
- Local variables that are declared in a local scope (anywhere else)

Storage:
Global variables are stored in the data segment in memory whereas local variables are
stored on the stack.
